I chose to work with the "[Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Data
Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset/data)"
this data includes demographic data such as gender and age. It includes
information about the users device such as the operating system and
device model. Data on their device use was also collected such as number
of apps installed, app usage time (min/day), battery consumption
(milliamp-hours/day), screen on time (hours/day), and data usage
(megabytes/day). They also classified user behavior on five number scale
ranging form light to extreme usage. I could not find what the
intermediate labels were so I used light-moderate, moderate,
moderate-extreme. I realized this data is so clean (i.e no missing
values) because it is simulated, based on trends, not raw observed data.
