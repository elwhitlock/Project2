This contains Elle Whitlock's Project 2 work for ST558 taught by Dr.
Justin Post

I chose to work with the "[Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Data
Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset/data)"
this data includes demographic data such as gender and age. It includes
information about the users device such as the operating system and
device model. Information on their device use was also collected such as
number of apps installed, app usage time (min/day), battery consumption
(milliamp-hours/day), screen on time (hours/day), and data usage
(megabytes/day). They also classified user behavior on five number scale
ranging form light to extreme usage. I could not find what the
intermediate labels were so I used light-moderate, moderate,
moderate-extreme. I realized this data is so clean (i.e. no missing
values) because it is simulated, based on trends, not raw observed data.
My app explores this data. In the side panel you can subset the data by
gender, operating system, and by modifying the range of values for any
two numeric variables. In the download tab, the data can be downloaded
in a csv format. Finally in the exploration tab you can learn about the
data. You can choose between looking at plots, or summaries. The plots
include six different types in which you can choose what variable(s) you
want to look at. For summaries you can create statistics with respect to
numeric variables, and contingency tables with respect to categorical
variables.
